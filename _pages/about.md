Welcome! I am an applied scientist at Amazon, working on improving sponsored shopping experience especially on the aspect of brand discovery. My research fields are in text representation learning, discriminative and generative sequence modeling, and their application in e-commerce. Previously, I earned my Master of Computational Data Science from Carnegie Mellon University in Dec 2019. During my graduate study, I was fortunate to work with Prof [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Prof [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/) on classification and generative modeling of text.

I graduate from Computer Science Department of Peking University in 2018. During my undergraduate study, I am supervised by Prof Ming Zhang and Prof [Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/) on text mining of clinical health records.
